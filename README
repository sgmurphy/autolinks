Autolinks is a PHP library for auto-hyperlinking URLs in plain text.

Example:

"Free CouchDB intro talk tonight at c-base, Berlin: http://jan.io/bkMW — See you there!"

Would be turned in to:

"Free CouchDB intro talk tonight at c-base, Berlin: <a href="http://jan.io/bkMW">http://jan.io/bkMW</a> — See you there!"
